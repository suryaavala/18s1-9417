- 3 convs followed by max pooling after input:
1. conv1: 32 features, 5x5 patch
2. conv2: 64 features, 5x5 patch
3. conv3: 128 features, 5x5 patch
4. Densely Connected Layer: image size has been reduced to 4x4 + fully connected layer with 1024 neurons to allow processing on entire image.
5. Readout layer: Softmax Regression on the Layer 4 to get probability of image classes (between 0-61)
